# Wireless RF Scanner Client

The Wireless RF Scanner Team has designed a scanner that tests the strength of a mobile network by scanning signals in a given frequency and bandwidth and displaying the relevant statistics. It serves as a portable and an affordable way for companies to measure and optimize wireless signals. The team has worked with DasPoint to gather the necessary parts for the project. The total cost of the parts was about $1500. Click the site link below to know more about us or check out our deliverables:
